## Voice and Tone
- **Modern and Tech-Forward:** Communication should be sleek, concise, and focused on the digital tools and platform features. Use clear, direct language that reflects the innovative nature of the platform.

## Brand Values
- **Nostalgia and Connection:** Evoke the feeling of physical fanzine culture while bridging it with modern tools. The goal is to celebrate the history of fanzines while revitalizing the sense of community they created in a digital context.

## Visual Identity
- **Clean and Minimalist:** The UI should be high-contrast and distraction-free, putting the content (the fanzines) front and center. Avoid unnecessary clutter to allow the artistic expression of the fanzines to stand out.

## Community and Moderation
- **Proactively Moderated:** Maintain a safe and respectful environment through clear community guidelines and active moderation. Focus on fostering a supportive space for all users.

## User Experience (UX)
- **Optimized Digital Reading:** The fanzine reader must prioritize clarity, ease of navigation, and high performance for long-form consumption on digital screens. The experience should feel natural and effortless for the reader.
